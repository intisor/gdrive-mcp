# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

1. Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
```bash
cd "C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\mcp-gdrive"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-gdrive-app.git
```

2. Push your code to GitHub:

git push -u origin main
```
